#**ABOUT ME**

**Name**:Tiffany Umeh



**Hometown:** Atlanta, GA 



**Prior IT Experience**
   

I began my IT journey in **B2B sales** at **AT&T**, where I was recruited into the prestigious **Business Sales Leadership Development Program (BSLDP)**. Upon graduating, I secured a role in the **Premier Client Group (PCG)** in Charlotte, NC. In this role, I was introduced to **IoT, networking systems, routers, switches, fiber optics, and mobile applications and devices**. This exposure sparked my passion for **networking**, recognizing it as the backbone of all technology.  

I was later recruited by **Ciena**, where I accepted a position as a **Business Sales Development Manager**. Here, I deepened my intrest in tech and security, gaining hands-on experience with the Ciena's technology and learning about the **OSI model, data transmission through networks, and security protocols**.  

My experience combines **consultative sales, a high level understanding of networking infrastructure, project management, and cybersecurity**, equipping me with a strong foundation in **uunderstanding the power and promise of technology, this also makes me a great candidate for this program because I have true passion to succeed and stay at the cutting edge of security and tech!**

**Career Plans:** 


After completing my cybersecurity course, I am exploring and really interested in **blending my background in networking, security, and program management with ethical hacking and cloud security**. I love the challenge of **identifying vulnerabilities, protecting systems, and staying ahead of emerging threats**.  

I'm drawn to **ethical hacking** because I enjoy **learning how systems can be compromised to better defend them**, but I’m also interested in **cloud security architecture and network security**. My goal is to step into roles like **Cloud Security Architect, Network Architect, or Cybersecurity Sales Engineer**, where I can **secure enterprise systems, protect IoT devices, and help businesses build stronger defenses**. I enjoy working with people and presenting so this area is of high interest.

I’m targeting industries that thrive on **innovation and security, like tech, IoT, and cloud security**. Long-term, I want to **combine my leadership, sales acumen, and technical expertise to drive impact—whether that’s designing secure systems, advising businesses on cybersecurity strategies, or becoming a thought leader in the field**.



**Proud Project/Task:**      

One of the projects I’m most proud of is **leading the restructuring of a new organization within The Home Depot’s Supply Chain Inventory and Replenishment (IPR) sector**. I took charge of organizing a completely new team, creating processes, and implementing **automation in Slack and Jira** to streamline support ticketing. The organization had the opprtunity to vote on a new Org name and my suggestion won! **IPR Health Tech**. This initiative not only **improved clarity and efficiency** for developers but also **increased productivity by 60%** and saved the company **millions** by reducing backlog inefficiencies by solving technical bottlenecks that were costing the company sometimes **MILLIONS!**  

What makes this project stand out to me is that it required **strategic leadership, problem-solving, and collaboration across multiple teams**. I had to bring structure to a chaotic environment, advocate for necessary changes, and implement solutions that made an immediate impact. Seeing the organization become more effective and witnessing the results firsthand reinforced my ability to **drive operational excellence and lead technical initiatives**.
