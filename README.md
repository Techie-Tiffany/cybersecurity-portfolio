<u>**ABOUT ME**</u>

<b>**Name**:</b> Tiffany Umeh



<B>Hometown:</B> Atlanta, GA 



<b>Prior IT Experience</b>
   

I began my IT journey in **B2B sales** at **AT&T**, where I was recruited into the prestigious **Business Sales Leadership Development Program (BSLDP)**. Upon graduating, I secured a role in the **Premier Client Group (PCG)** in Charlotte, NC. In this role, I was introduced to **IoT, networking systems, routers, switches, fiber optics, and mobile applications and devices**. This exposure sparked my passion for **networking**, recognizing it as the backbone of all technology.  

I was later recruited by **Ciena**, where I accepted a position as a **Business Sales Development Manager**. Here, I deepened my technical expertise, gaining hands-on experience with the **OSI model, data transmission through networks, and security protocols**.  

My experience combines **consultative sales, a high level understanding of networking infrastructure, project management, and cybersecurity**, equipping me with a strong foundation in **technology-driven business solutions**.

**Career Plans:** 


After completing my cybersecurity course, I want to **blend my background in networking, security, and program management with ethical hacking and cloud security**. I love the challenge of **identifying vulnerabilities, protecting systems, and staying ahead of emerging threats**.  

I'm drawn to **ethical hacking** because I enjoy **learning how systems can be compromised to better defend them**, but I’m also interested in **cloud security architecture and network security**. My goal is to step into roles like **Cloud Security Architect, Network Architect, or Cybersecurity Sales Engineer**, where I can **secure enterprise systems, protect IoT devices, and help businesses build stronger defenses**.  

I’m targeting industries that thrive on **innovation and security, like tech, IoT, and cloud security**. Long-term, I want to **combine my leadership, sales acumen, and technical expertise to drive impact—whether that’s designing secure systems, advising businesses on cybersecurity strategies, or becoming a thought leader in the field**.
